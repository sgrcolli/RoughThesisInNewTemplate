\chapter{Introduction to Reactor Monitoring} \label{Chap:theAimOfVidarr} %Title of the First Chapter
This chapter will go over the basic principle of anti-neutrino ($\bar{\nu}$) monitoring and what results are expected from this specific form of monitoring. There will be a light focus on what spectrum of energies will be expected from an $\bar{\nu}$ detector. But this chapter will mainly focus on the results and technology of other experiments currently in the field. This is done to give a grounded realistic view of what can be achieved with particular technology and setups. 

\section{Basic Overview of RMon and VIDARR}
The aim of the Verification Instrument for the Direct Assay of Radiation at Range (VIDARR) project is to demonstrate the potential usefulness of an electron anti-neutrino ($\bar{\nu_e}$) detector for safeguarding purposes. Between 2014 -- 2016 a prototype detector (RMon) based on the T2K ND 280 ECal \cite{Allan_2013} was deployed at the Wylfa reactor site. This deployment proved successful in measuring the reactor on period in 2014. However, there are improvements to the target mass, time resolution, improved Multi-Pixel Photon Counters (MPPCs), and temperature control which would greatly improve these results. An upgrade that implements all of these improvements is planned and has been characterised through GEANT4 \cite{Agostinelli:2002hh} simulations. In the modern political climate where nuclear power is seen as a stable form of low carbon power generation, more nations are considering the nuclear power once again. As such the concern of atomic weapons proliferation has increased. Current safeguards for non-proliferation are dependent on accurate bookkeeping and estimations from power generation. Whilst these methods are effective, more direct methods of measuring the flux from reactors, and thereby the production of weapons-grade material, would greatly aid international institutions and watchdogs.
% \\\\Anti-neutrino reactor monitoring also has potential benefits for utilising fuel more effectively. Increasing power generation whilst decreasing the amount of nuclear waste to be stored. This potential is not yet fully realised due to the increased complexity of this method as it requires differentiating between different isotopes rather than just measuring reactor $\bar{\nu_e}$ flux. Whether this is feasible will be tested once the upgrades to VIDARR are completed and it is deployed at a new reactor site.  

\section{Inverse $\beta$ Decay}
The VIDARR detector observes $\bar{\nu_e}$s via inverse $\beta$ decay (equation {\ref{inverse_beta_decay}}) via the weak interaction. The weak interaction doesn't conserve flavour as inverse $\beta$ decay seen in figure \ref{fig:inverse_beta_diagram} relies on an up quark transitioning to a down quark (uud $\rightarrow$ udd), this process can only be enabled through the weak interaction. This process is mediated through the W boson, not the, Z as the interaction has charged particles and charge must still be conserved in weak interactions. Due to the charge and colourless nature of neutrinos they only interact with other matter through the weak interaction. This leads to a small cross section of 10$^{-42}$\,cm$^2$\cite{Vogel_1999}, making anti-neutrinos difficult to detect. This also provides the ability for neutrinos to be observed even with significant shielding around the source. 
\begin{equation}
    \Bar{\nu_e} + p^+ \rightarrow n + e^+
    \label{inverse_beta_decay}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[!h]

  \label{fig:inverse_beta_diagram}
\end{figure}

In a reactor $\sim$ 200\,MeV is released per fission and 6 neutrinos along the $\beta$ decay chain are produced. ``Since unstable fission products are neutron-rich nuclei all $\beta$ decays are of $\beta^-$ type and the neutrino flux is actually pure electronic anti-neutrinos ($\bar{\nu_e}$)''\cite{Mueller_2011}, meaning that the $\bar{\nu_e}$s are the main particles of interest for reactor studies. If the $e^+$ energy can be accurately measured then it would also be possible to measure the $\bar{\nu_e}$ energy as well via equation \ref{nu_energy_eq}. Which shows the $\bar{\nu_e}$ energy in terms of well known quantities, the energy of the $e^+$ and the masses of the neutron and proton \cite{Vogel_1999}. 
\begin{equation}
 E_{\bar{\nu_e}} = E_{e^+} + (M_n - M_p) 
\label{nu_energy_eq}
\end{equation}

\section{Anti-neutrino Reactor Monitoring}
% Obviously the two papers to mention here are vogal and beacom 1999 \cite{Vogel_1999} and muller et al 2011 \cite{Mueller_2011}. They cover the ground pretty well. \cite{Mueller_2011} has the $10^{20}$ $\Bar{\nu_e}$/s per GW$^{Th}$ and \cite{Vogel_1999} has the cross section values. \cite{Vogel_1999} is mostly dealing with stuff to first order, it may be worth addressing how this changes with increasing order. But probably not considering the low number of events anti-neutrino detection yields. Worth also going over the cowan and riens \cite{Cowan1956Confirmation} \cite{cowan1957test} again just briefly. The songs s1 project is also a necessity in 2007 it marked the beginning of serious reactor monitoring \cite{Bowden_2007}. And of course the original soviet paper which suggested this is as a possibility \cite{Borovoi_1978}. Also need to mention the IAEA and there workshop which suggested the limitations for this \cite{IAEA_2008}. 
% \\\\Probably best to go onto semi chronologically with the Cowan and Reins approach stating that reactor monitoring was one of the original approaches as fuel decays through beta decay (equation \ref{modern_beta_decay}) and the detection occurs through equation \ref{inverse_beta_decay}. It may be worth also mentioning section \ref{Direct_Measurements_section}. Then mentioning the soviet paper \cite{Borovoi_1978} then the move on to the first prototype with SONGS1 and then \cite{Bowden_2007} which then informed the IAEA report \cite{IAEA_2008}. Then talk about vogel \cite{Vogel_1999} and muller \cite{Mueller_2011}.
Reactor monitoring was used to prove the existence of neutrinos. In 1953 the direct measurements of $\bar{\nu_e}$ from reactors was done by Cowan and Reins \cite{Cowan1956Confirmation}. The response of anti-neutrinos was measured in cadmium-doped liquid scintillator \cite{Cowan1956Confirmation} which used inverse $\beta$ decay (equation \ref{inverse_beta_decay}). This will be expanded upon in section \ref{Direct_Measurements_section}. $\sim$ 20 years after that experiment in 1978 it was proposed that measuring anti-neutrinos from reactors could be used for reactor monitoring \cite{Borovoi_1978}. However, due to the geopolitics of the time, the interest in non-proliferation was not as high as in modern times. It took until 2007 for the SONGS1 prototype to be deployed as proof of concept for reactor monitoring \cite{Bowden_2007}. 
\\\\After the deployment of the SONGS1 prototype the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) workshopped a list of positive traits that they would like to see in an anti-neutrino reactor monitoring detector. These traits include inert construction, non-liquid, easy operation, cheap, portable, robust, above-ground operation, easy deployment \cite{IAEA_2008}. Whilst these are not requirements, all of these traits can be met in a single detector. For example, VIDARR and RMon meet all of these traits. As it they were purpose built to do so. 
\\\\Reactors produce O $\sim$ $10^{20}$ $\Bar{\nu_e}$/s per GW$^{Th}$ as the fission products in the fuel elements $\beta$ decay \cite{Mueller_2011}. Though these rates are very high, the interaction cross-section to first order is $\sim 10^{-42}$cm$^2$ as can be seen in figure \ref{vogelAndBeacomCrossSection} \cite{Vogel_1999}. In addition to this different fission, fractions will decay at different rates as can be seen in figure \ref{mullerAndVogelCombined}. The combination of these two effects can be seen in figure \ref{mullerEtAlDetectedSpectrum} \cite{Mueller_2011}. From figure \ref{mullerEtAlDetectedSpectrum} the range of anti-neutrino energies expected to be detected ranges from $\sim$ 1.8\,MeV to $\sim$ 8.5\,MeV. The threshold is 1.804\,MeV as this is the mass difference between the initial and final states \cite{Mueller_2011}.

\end{figure}

It may be possible to discern the different fission fraction isotopes from their detected spectra. Providing the energy resolution, statistics, and location of the detector is sufficient. This would be very useful for non-proliferation purposes as measuring the $^{239}$Pu burn-up would lead to a more accurate measure of weapons-grade material than measuring on/off cycles. As online refuelling methods seen in reactors such as the Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors (AGRs) would not work around the measurement of $^{239}$Pu burn-up. The AGR reactor type can refuel online without shutting down. Therefore measure the reactor on/off cycle may not be sufficient for that specific reactor type. This is also true for other types such as pebble beds. As such the measurement of $^{239}$Pu burn-up is desirable. 

\section{Reactor $\bar{\nu_e}$ programs}\label{sec:exisitingReactorMonitoringPrograms}

\subsection{SONGS1 Detector}
The SONGS1 detector \cite{Bowden_2007} was the first $\bar{\nu_e}$ detector to be deployed and prove the technology was viable for non-proliferation purposes. The detector consists of three subsystems; a central detector containing the Gd-doped liquid scintillator target and photomultiplier tube (PMTs), a passive water or polyethylene shield on all sides and a plastic scintillator $\mu$ veto placed outside the water shield on 5 sides of the detector. The central detector seen in figure \ref{fig:SongsS1Detector} consists of four identical stainless steel cells with 0.64 tons of liquid scintillator in total \cite{Bowden_2007}. 
\\\\The SONGS1 detector has a stand off from the reactor core of 24.5 $\pm$ 1\,m \cite{Bowden_2007}. With the 0.64 ton detector a neutrino rate of 407 $\pm$ 75/day was expected according to the SONGS1 collaboration \cite{Bowden_2007}. When the data was processed the count rate was slightly higher at turn on as seen in figure \ref{subFig:reactorPowerSongsS1} but was closer to the expected rate once the bin sizes are increased as seen in figure \ref{subFig:reactorRefulingSongs1} \cite{Bowden_2008}. Increasing the averaging time to 30 days allowed for the observation of fuel burn-up (see figure \ref{subFig:reactorRefulingSongs1}) \cite{Bowden_2008}. This presents a tantalising opportunity that other collaborations might be able to expand upon with improved energy and timing resolution. But weather quantifying fuel burn-up is possible with reactor monitoring remains to be seen at time of writing.

\end{figure}

\subsection{PANDA}
The Plastic Anti-Neutrino Detector Array (PANDA) \cite{PANDA_2012}, \cite{PANDA_2014}, \cite{PANDA_tgf}, \cite{IIRIE_Panda_2021}, is a segmented detector that uses plastic and Gadolinium shown in figure \ref{subFig:pandaClose}, the gadolinium's interaction with neutrons is shown in equation \ref{equ:gadolinumNAbsorption}. The bars clustered together can be seen in figure \ref{subFig:pandaFar}. The bars seen in figure \ref{subFig:pandaFar} are plastic scintillator with dimensions of 10\,cm $\times$ 10\,cm $\times$ 100\,cm with two 10\,cm\ $\times$ 10\,cm $\times$ 10\,cm acrylic cubic light guides are glued to both ends of the plastic scintillator with optical cement capped with photon multiplier tubes at either end of the bars for data collection \cite{PANDA_2014}. The interior of a plastic scintillating bar can be seen in figure \ref{subFig:pandaClose} which also shows the prompt and delayed event of an $\bar{\nu_e}$ event. In addition calibrations and comparison to GEANT4 \cite{Agostinelli:2002hh} have been performed with a baseline of a $^{60}$Co with reasonable agreement between the calibration source and the simulated response \cite{PANDA_2012}. 

\begin{equation}
n + {^{155,157}Gd} \rightarrow {^{156,158} Gd} + \gamma (\sim 8\,MeV)
\label{equ:gadolinumNAbsorption}
\end{equation}

\label{fig:pandaCloseFar}
\end{figure}

The bars are not positioned perpendicularly in the $z$ direction (figure \ref{subFig:pandaFar}). Therefore tracking is more difficult in PANDA, due to not having specific $x$ and $y$ coordinates, this makes vetoing cosmic $\mu$ (a major source of background) potentially harder in PANDA than if the bars were perpendicular. The photon multiplier tubes (PMTs) used in PANDA are also expensive, the PANDA36 shown in figure \ref{subFig:pandaFar} is much smaller than the proposed final design of 100 channels and 1m$^3$ \cite{PANDA_2012} but PANDA is being built in stages because of the expense of these components. However, the potential for measuring many photons with high efficiency makes PMTs attractive. Both Lesser PANDA (16 channels) and PANDA36 have been deployed by van with background measurements and reactor measurements being taken from inside the van \cite{PANDA_2012}, \cite{PANDA_2014}. But due to the flammable nature of petrol and diesel, it is unclear whether reactor operators would be open to having a van stationed indefinitely outside their reactor buildings. PANDA36 has also been used for monitoring Terrestrial $\gamma$-ray Flashes (TGFs) from thunderstorms to allow for further background reduction at nuclear sites\cite{PANDA_tgf}.
\\\\In 2016 PANDA was upgraded to have 100 channels called the PANDA100 it began taking background measurements in 2019 \cite{Iwata_2019}. The PANDA 100 started taking measurements at the Ohi power plant in 2018 for background subtraction and then made measurements of the neutrino events in 2019 from Ohi reactors 3 and 4. The results of the neutrino measurements from the reactors is shown in figure \ref{subFig:Panda_spectrumOfIbdCandidates} and the background spectrum is shown in \ref{subFig:Panda_SpectrumOfCosmicProducts}. The results from PANDA's deployment are very impressive. With the near (45\,m) and far (100\,m) positions from the reactor being of similar range to the RMon deployment at Wyfla \cite{Carroll_2018}. In addition the neutrino rate of 175.8 $\pm$ 34.4 day$^{-1}$ \cite{IIRIE_Panda_2021} matches the $\sim 200$ events day$^{-1}$ that RMon measured at Wylfa \cite{Carroll_2018}. Of particular interest in the PANDA results is the neutrino spectrum produced in figure \ref{subFig:Panda_spectrumOfIbdCandidates} as it resembles the expected shape from Muller 2011 \cite{Mueller_2011} predicted (see figure \ref{mullerEtAlDetectedSpectrum}).

\end{figure}

\subsection{SoLid and CHANDLER}
The SoLid detector is a plastic scintillating detector that uses wavelength shifting (WLS) fibres with MPPCs at the end to read out fibre signals and adjacent 5\,cm $\times$ 5\,cm $\times$ 5\,cm cubes being lit up at similar time intervals to discern particles \cite{Solid_proposal}. There is a prompt signal outputted from the positron in the plastic cubes and a delayed signal from the $^6$LiF:ZnS(Ag) screen interacting with neutrons as shown in figure \ref{fig:SolidCubeDiagram}. The prompt positron response and delayed neutron response is similar to the other experiments mentioned. In SoLid $^6$Li is used as the neutron capture agent (equation \ref{Li_interact_eq}), which produces an $\alpha$ and a 4.78\,MeV $\gamma$ \cite{Solid_readout}. The $\gamma$ signal is ignored because the $\alpha$ signal produced is clear and produces a specific pulse shape signal \cite{Solid_readout} which has a very minimal background due to its specific pulse shape. Setting it apart from other experiments that use the 8\,MeV Gd cascade. 

\begin{equation}
n + {^6Li} \rightarrow {^3H} + \alpha +4.78\,MeV
\label{Li_interact_eq}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[!h]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[height=58mm]{Chapter2/Figs/Raster/SoLid_cube.png}
 \captionof{figure}{SoLid cube during an inverse beta decay event anti-neutrino decays into a positron and neutron via equation \ref{inverse_beta_decay}, delayed neutron is captured by $^6$LiF:ZnS(Ag) screen, positron gives the prompt response. From \cite{Solid_readout}.} 
 \label{fig:SolidCubeDiagram}
\end{figure}

The challenge with using $^6$Li as a neutron capture agent is producing enough light for pulse shape discrimination (PSD) to be used in the analysis. The $\alpha$s need to be captured by the sulphur in the $^6$LiF:ZnS(Ag) screen which then emits a specific $\gamma$ into the plastic which in turn produces electrons via Compton scattering which are then captured by WLS fibres. An alternative method to this is that proposed by CHANDLER (Carbon Hydrogen Anti-Neutrino Detector with a Lithium Enhanced Raghavan-optical-lattice) \cite{aap2015}. Which uses PMT's and a Raghavan-optical-lattice to counter-act the low light issues in SoLid. However, the CHANDLER design also brings challenges as the detector cannot be too large otherwise attenuation and containment of events prevent signals from being read.
\\\\The SoLid experiment has collected data up to June 2020 and is current deployed at the BR2 reactor in Belgium [6300 mm–8938 mm] from the nominal reactor core \cite{Abreu_2021}. The results from the period of July 2018 -- August 2019. The trigger strategy for for SoLid neutrinos relies solely on triggering on a scintillation signal generated in the
neutron detection screens (NS). The values for the NS rate for SoLid at BR2 can be seen in figure \ref{fig:solidReults}. As such figure \ref{fig:solidReults} shows how the SoLid detector is triggering as expected for an anti-neutrino detector. Currently the SoLid collaboration approximates the detector is subject to $\sim$ 1000 per day though the short bursts the BR2 causes difficulty through off-equilibrium effects \cite{Abreu_2021}.

\subsection{Double Chooz}
%I feel like Double Chooz, Reno, KamLAND and Daya Bay are all very similar, liquid scintillating detectors with Gd doping initlally trying to find theta_13 but then transitioned to the 5 MeV reactor bump all of these are not proliforation focussed but measrument focussed experiments 
%Double Chooz is probably one of the most well known reactor monitoring programs. \cite{abe2014improved} goes over some of the details and I have already mentioned it here. Also the \cite{lasserre2006} reference may be useful, used it once before in the first year literature survey. I've also cited \cite{Abe_2012} in the past and that may prove useful here. Further the reference \cite{Olive_2014} may also be of use. Double Chooz is a good one to cite because its clearly not in competition with VIDARR. It requires to be very close and a big hole dug underground and uses gadolinium suspended in liquid organic scintillator. Which is not cheap or portable, it does however give significantly better measurements for the disappearance of anti-neutrinos which the above references mention.
The Double Chooz experiment is an evolution of the original Chooz experiment which was set up at the Chooz nuclear power plant in France\cite{lasserre2006}. Both of these experiments attempted to measure the $\Bar{\nu_e}$ disappearance from the same reactor however the original Chooz experiment was unable to see any disappearance to a 90$\,\%$ confidence level \cite{Apollonio_2003}. Both experiments used gadolinium doped liquid scintillator with the Double Chooz experiment having a near and far detector at 280\,m and 1050\,m respectively\cite{lasserre2006}. Finally, in 2012 $\Bar{\nu_e}$ disappearance was observed at the Double Chooz experiment \cite{Abe_2012}. These results were improved further in 2014 \cite{abe2014improved}.

 \label{DoubleChoozNearDetector}
\end{figure}
\\\\The Double Chooz experiment uses detectors placed underground to allow for a large amount of overburden to reduce background rates. As seen in figure \ref{DoubleChoozNearDetector} the overburden for the near detector is 30\,m resulting in 300 water meter equivalent (w.m.e) \cite{lasserre2006}. This high overburden was chosen to keep a high true-neutrino-signal to background ratio. The far detector only has 70-80\,m.w.e and so the outer shielding is different \cite{lasserre2006}. The Double Chooz measurement  was not the first to measure the rate of $\Bar{\nu_e}$ disappearance \cite{reno_may_2012} it was able to produce a spectrum of the $\Bar{\nu_e}$ disappearance for $\theta_{13}$ (A component Pontecorvo–Maki–Nakagawa–Sakata (PMNS) that will be explained in section \ref{sec:neutrinoFlavours}) which can be seen in \ref{doubleChoozSpectrumNoCaption}. The measured energy spectrum which can be seen as black points in figure \ref{doubleChoozSpectrumNoCaption}, the closest match to the data in the double Chooz data was found to the fitted red line with a $\sin^2{2\theta_{13}}$ = 0.109 $\pm$0.030(stat)$\pm$0.025(syst) as seen in figure \ref{doubleChoozSpectrumNoCaption} \cite{Abe_2012}. The data exclude the no-oscillation hypothesis at 99.8$\%$ CL (2.9$\sigma$)\cite{Abe_2012}. This data was further expanded upon in 2014 producing a result of $\sin^2{2\theta_{13}}$ = 0.090$^{+0.032}_{-0.029}$ using 467.90 live days of data to within $3.0\sigma$ \cite{abe2014improved}.

\subsection{RENO}
%Papers found by this collaboration include \cite{reno_may_2012}, \cite{reno2013},  \cite{reno_may_2019}. 
RENO was the first collaboration to see $\Bar{\nu_e}$ disappearance \cite{Olive_2014}. The RENO experiment consisted of two detectors at a distance of 408.56\,m for the near detector, and 1443.99\,m for the far detector \cite{reno_may_2012}. A schematic of the detectors used in RENO can be seen in figure \ref{RENO_detector}, this detection system again uses Gd-doped liquid scintillator with PMTs.

RENO's results in 2012 were consistent with neutrino oscillations to within 4.9 $\sigma$ from 6 2.8\,$GW_{th}$ reactors. The result from RENO in 2012 using a rate based analysis was $\sin^2{2\theta_{13}}$ = 0.113$\pm0.013$(stat.)$\pm0.019$(syst.) which was consistent with the findings that Double Chooz would produce later. These results were revised once again in 2013 using 800 days of live time to $\sin^2{2\theta_{13}}$ = 0.100 $\pm$ 0.010(stat) $\pm$ 0.015 (sys.) corresponding to 6.3 $\sigma$ significance \cite{reno2013}. The focus of the RENO collaboration has since shifted to analysing the 5\,MeV reactor anomaly \cite{reno_may_2019}.  

\subsection{Other Experiments}
There are similar experiments to both Double Chooz and RENO. For example, the Daya Bay experiment in China uses similar technology to measure anti-neutrinos from reactors \cite{DayaBay2007Precision}. Similar to other experiments in this field the Daya Bay experiment has started to investigate the reactor anomaly at 5\,MeV \cite{Daya_Bay_2017}. Nucifer is also similar to the other experiments being a scaled-down version of Double Chooz, Daya Bay and RENO using Gd doped liquid scintillator with the goal of near field reactor monitoring \cite{nucifer2016}. Another experiment of interest is the WATCHMAN collaboration which has the goal of far-field reactor monitoring using $\bar{\nu_e}$ originally planned to be deployed in the U.S.A \cite{askins2015physics} it has since become a joint U.S, U.K project and will be deployed at Boulby mine \cite{burns2018remote}. Its technology is in a state of flux but will use Gd in a fluid detector. There has been some external collaboration between the VIDARR experiment and the WATCHMAN experiment. In particular, the application of the DANCE calorimeter data to form a Dicebox for Gadolinium which VIDARR has also taken advantage of as part of this work.
