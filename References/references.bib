We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as heavy neutrinos, supersymmetric and technicolor particles, axions, dark photons, etc. All the particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We also give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Supersymmetry, Extra Dimensions, Particle Detectors, Probability, and Statistics. Among the 112 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised including those on: Dark Energy, Higgs Boson Physics, Electroweak Model, Neutrino Cross Section Measurements, Monte Carlo Neutrino Generators, Top Quark, Dark Matter, Dynamical Electroweak Symmetry Breaking, Accelerator Physics of Colliders, High-Energy Collider Parameters, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, Astrophysical Constants and Cosmological Parameters. All tables, listings, and reviews (and errata) are also available on the Particle Data Group website: http://pdg.lbl.gov.},

This paper focuses on the basic properties and performance of the detector. We describe the site, the reactor source, and the detector, and provide data that clearly show the expected antineutrino signal. Our data and experience demonstrate that it is possible to operate a simple, relatively small, antineutrino detector near a reactor, in a non-intrusive and unattended mode for months to years at a time, from outside the reactor containment, with no disruption of day-to-day operations at the reactor site. This unique real-time cooperative monitoring capability may be of interest for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reactor safeguards program and similar regimes."

The multiplicity distributions of the {gamma} decay were used to determine the resonance spins up to E{sub n}=300 eV. The {gamma}-ray energy spectra for different multiplicities were measured for the s-wave resonances. The shapes of these spectra were compared with simulations based on the use of the DICEBOX statistical model code. Simulations showed that the scissors mode is required not only for the ground-state transitions but also for transitions between excited states.},

title = {Sequential Minimal Optimization: A Fast Algorithm for Training Support Vector Machines},
institution = {Microsoft},
year = {1998},
month = {April},
abstract = {This paper proposes a new algorithm for training support vector machines: Sequential Minimal Optimization, or SMO. Training a support vector machine requires the solution of a very large quadratic programming (QP) optimization problem. SMO breaks this large QP problem into a series of smallest possible QP problems. These small QP problems are solved analytically, which avoids using a time-consuming numerical QP optimization as an inner loop. The amount of memory required for SMO is linear in the training set size, which allows SMO to handle very large training sets. Because matrix computation is avoided, SMO scales somewhere between linear and quadratic in the training set size for various test problems, while the standard chunking SVM algorithm scales somewhere between linear and cubic in the training set size. SMO's computation time is dominated by SVM evaluation, hence SMO is fastest for linear SVMs and sparse data sets. On real-world sparse data sets, SMO can be more than 1000 times faster than the chunking algorithm.},

Different approaches already exist (e.g. gravimetry, electrical tomography) that give access to a wide range of information but with identified limitations or drawbacks (e.g. intrinsic ambiguity of the inverse problem, time consuming deployment of sensors over large distances). Here we present an alternative and complementary tomography method based on the measurement of the cosmic muons flux attenuation through the geological structures. We detail the basics of this muon tomography with a special emphasis on the photo-active detectors.}

The evaluations benefit from recent experimental data obtained in the U.S. and Europe, and improvements in theory and simulation. Notable advances include updated evaluated data for light nuclei, structural materials, actinides, fission energy release, prompt fission neutron and γ-ray spectra, thermal neutron scattering data, and charged-particle reactions. Integral validation testing is shown for a wide range of criticality, reaction rate, and neutron transmission benchmarks. In general, integral validation performance of the library is improved relative to the previous ENDF/B-VII.1 library.}

After a study using background radiation in the laboratory at Kitasato University in Tokyo, we carried out a measurement of γ-ray bursts under the thunderclouds at Mt. Norikura in Gifu, Japan employing the PANDA100. As the results, we found three burst candidates in the data of 38 days. The original purpose of the PANDA project is to measure antineutrinos from a Japanese commercial reactor. We joined the Japanese reactor monitoring community arranged by University of Fukui group. In this community, we share the information about Japanese reactor activities and developement of a new monitoring tool. We are also preparing for a reactor monitoring with the PANDA100 when Japanese reactors resumed operation.}

This paper describes the SoLid detection principle, the mechanical design and the construction of the detector. It then reports on the installation and commissioning on site near the BR2 reactor, Belgium, and finally highlights its performance in terms of detector response and calibration.}

The techniques developed by these experiments make it possible to use these very weakly interacting particles for a practical purpose. The large flux of antineutrinos that leaves a reactor carries information about two quantities of interest for safeguards: the reactor power and fissile inventory. Measurements made with antineutrino detectors could therefore orer an alternative means for verifying the power history and fissile inventory of a reactors, as part of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other reactor safeguards regimes. Several erorts to develop this monitoring technique are underway across the globe.}

PROSPECT is conceived as a 2-phase experiment utilizing segmented 6Li-doped liquid scintillator detectors for both efficient detection of reactor antineutrinos through the inverse beta decay reaction and excellent background discrimination. PROSPECT Phase I consists of a movable 3 ton antineutrino detector at distances of 7–12 m from the reactor core. It will probe the best-fit point of the disappearance experiments at 4σ in 1 year and the favored region of the sterile neutrino parameter space at in 3 years. With a second antineutrino detector at 15–19 m from the reactor, Phase II of PROSPECT can probe the entire allowed parameter space below 10 eV2 at 5σ in 3 additional years. The measurement of the reactor antineutrino spectrum and the search for short-baseline oscillations with PROSPECT will test the origin of the spectral deviations observed in recent experiments, search for sterile neutrinos, and conclusively address the hypothesis of sterile neutrinos as an explanation of the reactor anomaly.}

Subsurface applications of the technology include tracking fluid migration during injection or production, with increasing concern regarding such timely issues as induced seismicity or chemical leakage into aquifers. Current density monitoring options include gravimetric data collection and active or passive seismic surveys. One alternative, or complement, to these methods is the development of a muon detector that is sufficiently compact and robust for deployment in a borehole. Such a muon detector can enable imaging of density structure to monitor small changes in density – a proxy for fluid migration – at depths up to 1500m. Such a detector has been developed, and Monte Carlo modeling methods applied to simulate the anticipated detector response. Testing and measurements using a prototype detector in the laboratory and shallow underground laboratory demonstrated robust response. A satisfactory comparison with a large drift tube-based muon detector is also presented.}

abstract = {We have developed a novel radiographic imaging method to survey the inhomogeneous structure of the crust. As an example, we performed measurements at Mt. Asama volcano, and studied the feasibility of using an azimuthally isotropic flux of cosmic-ray muons in the energy range up to a few TeV. The principle of the technique is that by measuring muon absorption along different nearly horizontal paths through a solid body, one can deduce the density distribution in the interior of the object. A muon detector with an area of 4000 cm2 was installed in a 1-m deep instrument vault located about 1 km from the summit crater of Mt. Asama. Muon tracks within emulsion layers in the detector were analyzed by 3d image processing to determine the level of energy absorption along different ray paths through the summit crater region. A typical angular resolution of the muon detector of 10 milliradians (mrad) corresponds to a spatial resolution of 10 m at a distance of 1 km. The measurements would be ideal for studying the shallow structure of the crust at sites which cannot be well resolved because of their strong structural heterogeneity and potential difficulty to be accessed, and which therefore cannot have their structure determined by conventional electromagnetic or seismic techniques. The present method can also provide three dimensional images of the subsurface by making measurements from two or more different points. In this work, we have radiographically imaged a few hundred meters below the crater floor of Mt. Asama, Japan, and have detected a dense region, which corresponds to the position and shape of a lava mound created during the last eruption (Urabe, B., Watanabe, N., Murakami, M., Topographic change of the summit crater of Asama Volcano during the 2004 eruption derived from Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) measurements, Bulletin of Geographical Survey Institute, 53, 1–6 (2006).). Right below the lava mound we found a low density region that suggests a drain-back-induced porous conduit (Urabe, B., Watanabe, N., Murakami, M., Topographic change of the summit crater of Asama Volcano during the 2004 eruption derived from Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) measurements, Bulletin of Geographical Survey Institute, 53, 1–6 (2006).). The density contrast was resolved with a precision of 1–3%. This method provides a resolution of the shallow density structure that is significantly higher than is possible with conventional geophysical measurements.}

    abstract = { High-energy muons generated from cosmic-ray particle showers have been shown to exhibit properties ideal for imaging the interior of large and dense structures. This paper explores the possibility of using a single portable muon detector in conjunction with image reconstruction methods used in nuclear medicine to reconstruct a 3-D image of the interior of critical infrastructure such as the Zero-Energy Deuterium (ZED-2) research reactor at Canadian Nuclear Laboratories’ Chalk River site. The ZED-2 reactor core and muon detector arrangement are modeled in GEANT4 and Monte Carlo measurements of the resultant muon throughput and angular distribution at several angles of rotation around the reactor are generated. Statistical analysis is then performed on these measurements based on the well-defined flux and angular distribution of muons expected near the surface of the earth. The results of this analysis are shown to produce reconstructed images of the spatial distribution of nuclear fuel within the core for multiple fuel configurations. This one-sided tomography concept is a possible candidate for examining the internal structure of larger critical facilities, for example the Fukushima Daiichi power plant, where the integrity of the containment infrastructure and the location of the reactor fuel is unknown. }

    abstract = { Cosmic rays are high-energy particles arriving from space; some have energies far beyond those that human-made particle accelerators can achieve. The sources of higher-energy cosmic rays remain under debate, although we know that lower-energy cosmic rays come from the solar wind. The Pierre Auger Collaboration reports the observation of thousands of cosmic rays with ultrahigh energies of several exa–electron volts (about a Joule per particle), arriving in a slightly dipolar distribution (see the Perspective by Gallagher and Halzen). The direction of the rays indicates that the particles originated in other galaxies and not from nearby sources within our own Milky Way Galaxy. Science, this issue p. 1266; see also p. 1240 The highest-energy cosmic rays have a dipolar distribution, showing that they originate outside our Galaxy. Cosmic rays are atomic nuclei arriving from outer space that reach the highest energies observed in nature. Clues to their origin come from studying the distribution of their arrival directions. Using 3 × 104 cosmic rays with energies above 8 × 1018 electron volts, recorded with the Pierre Auger Observatory from a total exposure of 76,800 km2 sr year, we determined the existence of anisotropy in arrival directions. The anisotropy, detected at more than a 5.2σ level of significance, can be described by a dipole with an amplitude of 6.5−0.9+1.3 percent toward right ascension αd = 100 ± 10 degrees and declination δd = −24−13+12 degrees. That direction indicates an extragalactic origin for these ultrahigh-energy particles. }

The evidence for each origin is discussed and a plausible synthesis outlined for the particles of Galactic origin where the energy comes mainly (but not exclusively) from supernova explosions, the site of the acceleration is at strong collisionless shock waves, and the accelerated particles come from the interstellar and circumstellar material swept over by these shocks. If these shocks are capable (as indicated by recent observations and theoretical work) of significantly amplifying magnetic fields this picture appears capable of explaining the cosmic ray particles at all energies below the ‘ankle’ at 3×1018eV. The particles above this energy are generally taken to be of extra-galactic origin and possible acceleration sites for these UHE particles are briefly discussed.}

This reaction is applied for several neutrino experiments, e.g. reactor neutrino experiments and Gd doped large water Cherenkov detector experiments, to recognize inverse-beta-decay reaction. A good Gd(n,γ) simulation model is needed to evaluate the detection efficiency of the neutron capture reaction, i.e. the efficiency of IBD detection.

    abstract = "{Natural gadolinium is widely used for its excellent thermal neutron capture cross section, because of its two major isotopes: \\$^\\{\\rm 155\\}\\$Gd and \\$^\\{\\rm 157\\}\\$Gd. We measured the \\$\\gamma\\$-ray spectra produced from the thermal neutron capture on targets comprising a natural gadolinium film and enriched \\$^\\{\\rm 155\\}\\$Gd (in Gd\\$\_\\{2\\}\\$O\\$\_\\{3\\}\\$ powder) in the energy range from 0.11 MeV to 8.0 MeV, using the ANNRI germanium spectrometer at MLF, J-PARC. The freshly analyzed data of the \\$^\\{\\rm 155\\}\\$Gd(\\$n, \\gamma\\$) reaction are used to improve our previously developed model (ANNRI-Gd model) for the \\$^\\{\\rm 157\\}\\$Gd(\\$n, \\gamma\\$) reaction [K. Hagiwara et al. [ANNRI-Gd Collaboration], Prog. Theor. Exp. Phys. 2019, 023D01 (2019)], and its performance confirmed with the independent data from the \\$^\\{\\rm nat\\}\\$Gd(\\$n, \\gamma\\$) reaction. This article completes the development of an efficient Monte Carlo model required to simulate and analyze particle interactions involving the thermal neutron captures on gadolinium in any relevant future experiments.}",
