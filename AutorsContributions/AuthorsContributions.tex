\chapter{Author's Contribution}

By it's very nature the scientific procsess is collaborative the work presentd in his thesis is built on the work that has come befor and during the work presented. 
\\\\The initial RMON deployment at Wylfa was done by Jon Coleman, Carl Metelko, Mathew Murdock and Yan-Jie Schnellbach from June 2016 to February 2018. The calibration of the data from wylfa was done by Mathew Murdock. The analysis of the calibrated data for cosmic $\mu$ tomography was done by me (Ronald Collins). Whereas the analysis for the $\Bar{\nu_e}$ was done by Matt Murdock and Yan-Jie Schnellbach. 
\\\\The RMON detector is currently in the processes of being upgraded into the VIDARR detector. The electronics for the upgrade have been handled by Carl Metelko. The new contianment has been handled by Oliver Caunt. Overal managment has been uder the watchfull eye of Jon Coleman. Whereas the assumbly has mostly been handled by myself and Yan-Jie schnellbach. The assembly has included cutting scintillator, painting the ends of bars, putting scintillator in the detector housing, labelling cables, assebmling PCBs, putting the electronics in the detector, 3D pringing fibre holders and sheaths, assembling the multi pixel photon counters into their holders, and attaching and labelling the 2660 coaxial cables that connect the electronics to the detector's instruments. In addition kieran bridges has been behind the improvements to cooling including the new radiators which I have also helped with. 
\\\\The simulation for a single bar and the whole detector was originally started by Matt Murdock and Yan-Jie Schellbach.  I have extended the simulation by quantifying the responce of the detector in simulation. Adding shielding, dead channels, TiO$_2$ coating around the bars. Further I have expanded the cosmic $\mu$  simulation for tomographic purposes including a more realistic distribution and simulating reactor buildings in simulation. The I added data driven effects such as dark noise and attenuation which used measurements from the single bar test stand that George Holt took. 
\\\\I have been the sole coder of the VIDARR analysis chain which has inspired by the RMON analysis chain created by Matt Murdock and Yan-Jie Schnellbach. This analysis chain can analyse measured dat from RMON and simulated data from both RMON and VIDARR. The single bar simulations are analysed by separate code also written by me.
