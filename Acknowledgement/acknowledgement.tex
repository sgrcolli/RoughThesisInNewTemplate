I would like to thank my family as they have been a great support. In particular, I would like to thank my mother who has put up with many a frustrated phone call. And of course my lovely boyfriend Michael who convinced me to get our two lovely cats, and has been wonderfully supportive and had to put up with years of whining. And I would also like to acknowledge my supervisors Dr. Jon Coleman and Dr. Carl Metelko as well as Dr. Yan-Jie Schnellbach who were a great help during the entirety of my PhD.
