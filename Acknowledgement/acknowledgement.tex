I would like to thank my family as they have been a great support. In particular, I would like to thank my mother who has put up with many a frustrated phone call. And of course my lovely boyfriend who had to put up with years of whining. And I would also like to acknowledge my supervisors Dr. Jon Coleman and Dr. Carl Metelko as well as Dr. Yan-Jie Schnellbach who was a great help during the entirety of my PhD.
