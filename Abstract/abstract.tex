\normalsize This thesis will focus on the Verification Instrument for the Direct Assay of Radiation at Range (VIDARR). It will cover the aims of the project and the technology used in its construction. This is especially relevant as the detector is being upgraded, the construction of which will be covered in this thesis as well. In order to help quantify this upgrade a simulation has been constructed which includes the improvements to the electronics made in the upgrade as well as the physical effects of quenching and attenuation. In addition, a dicebox based based on the DANCE calorimeter has been added to the simulation to more accurately model the gadolinium cascade which serves as VIDARR's trigger signal. Finally data from the prototype's deployment at Wylfa is analysed using a custom built cosmic $\mu$ tomography is able to analyse and image its surroundings. When used in combination with the aforementioned simulation allows for the resolution of many different buildings at the reactor site. This includes height inferences and resolving the reactor core with as little as $\sim$ hours of livetime data. Which should prove useful in aiding VIDARR's goal of reactor monitoring as this gaurds against the detector being moved.\\
