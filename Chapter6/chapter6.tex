The VIDARR project is supposed to primarily focus on the measurement of $\Bar{\nu_e}$s from reactors. Whilst a prototype of the detector did measure $\Bar{\nu_e}$ data from 07-07-2014 to 25-02-2016 at the Wylfa reactor site (see figure \ref{fig:prototypeMeasumentFlux}) the results had a high noise level due to the condition of the electronics and container being sub-optimal. Both of which will be improved with better electronics and an improved container as described in section \ref{sec:DetectorConstruction}. In addition there were only 1793 channels that were instrumented out of a possible 2660 channels only $\sim$ 67\,\% of the detector. It is known that not only would the efficiency of the neutron data improve but the so would the quality of the containment of the gadolinium cascade (see figure \ref{fig:containment_comparison}). The upgrade seeks to address all of these issues increasing the overall signal to noise and increasing the number of signal events by $\sim$ 50\,\% from $\sim$ 200 (see figure \ref{fig:prototypeMeasumentFlux}) to $\sim$ 300. There are many experiments that are also looking at $\Bar{\nu_e}$s from reactors (see section \ref{sec:exisitingReactorMonitoringPrograms}). The number of these experiments suggest that this will be healthy and productive field for years to come. 
\\\\In order to quantify the capabilities of the upgraded detector the GEANT4 simulation has been continuously worked on and improved in tandem with the upgrade. Taking into account the detector effects such as the MPPC response and dark noise ( see figure \ref{fig:fitting_of_non_peak_dark_noise}) as well as counting statistics (see figure \ref{fig:CoutingStats10}) and attenuation (see figure \ref{fig:attenuationPlot}) and quenching in the plastic (see section \ref{sec:geant4Simulation_quenchingLoss}). Unfortunately the on going pandemic caused by COVID-19 has restricted the supply of electronics and as such an error made by the producer of our electronics has been more time consuming to fix than expected. As a result there has been much focus on improving the simulation such as improving the Gd cascade (see section \ref{sec:geant4Simulation_gdCascade}) and testing machine learning techniques on that generated data (see section \ref{sec:MachineLearningTrigger}). But the biggest change to this thesis has been the large focus on cosmic $\mu$ tomography as opposed to analysing pure $\Bar{\nu_e}$ data.
